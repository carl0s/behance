This small module provides a primitive integration with Behance API (www.behance.net/dev).
At this moment to let this work you need to download this feature (check out http://www.drupal.org/project/features) -> http://code.nois3lab.it/behance/behance_basic-7.x-1.0.tar

It basically gives you the ability to download every project from a particular user and save each of them in a separate node.
